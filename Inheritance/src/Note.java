                     Polymorphism
       It simply means "many forms".
         As we have seen that animal can take multiple forms, the base
         class animal or a dog, or a fish,
       And as we have seen , some advantages of polymorphism are:
              1) it makes code simpler :
                We can write code once using the base class or super
                class, as I did with my doAnimalStuff method.
                I wrote that code without ever having to know about
                subclass types. I didn't have to write code to check the
                type of the object and then decide what method to call.
                Java did all that at runtime.

             2) It encourages code extensibility:
                It's very easy to subclass and override or extend the method,
                that'll be called, as I demonstrated.
