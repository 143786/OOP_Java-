            Encapsulation
      In Java, encapsulation means hiding things by making them
      private or inaccessible.
      Why hide things ?
      why would we want to hide things in Java ?
        1) To make the interface simpler, we may want to hide unnecessary
      details.
        2) To protect the integrity of data on an object, we may hide
        or restrict access to some of the data and operations.

        3) To decouple the published interface from the internal details
        of the class, we may hide actual names and types of class members.
        * This gives us more flexibility if we have to change the class in the
        future.
                What do we mean by interface here ??
        Java has a type called interface, that's not what we're talking about here.
        When I talk about a class's public or published interface, I'm really talking
        about the class members that are exposed to or can be accessed by the calling code.

        Everything else in the class in internal or private to it.

        An application programming interface or API is the public contract that tells others
        how to use the class.
